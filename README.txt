Upgraded Mengal & Zainee Website (Gifts + LoveWall)

Files:
- login.html (default passwords set)
- index.html (home)
- chat.html (demo UI)
- games.html (demo UI)
- countdown.html (info)
- gifts.html (52 romantic Roman Urdu/Hindi lines; click to reveal)
- lovewall.html (12 longer messages prefilled; local add messages feature)
- assets/style.css

How to use:
1. Unzip and upload files to your GitHub repo (drag & drop).
2. For local testing, open login.html in your browser.
3. Default account passwords (set into localStorage):
   - Mengal: 1231991@mng
   - Zainee: mengal@mng

Notes:
- Lovewall uses localStorage for privacy. If you want it synced via Firebase, tell me and I'll enable it.
- I can also integrate these pages into your full Firebase-enabled project and add nicer animations/sounds on demand.
